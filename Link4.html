<B></B>Difficulties<Br> <Br> 
 
The creation of The Matrix faced several difficulties, <Br>
including the development of innovative visual effects like the famous<Br> 
bullet time, which required the design of new techniques with dozens of <Br>
cameras and was expensive and complex to execute. Furthermore, the script <Br>
was too philosophical and confusing for the studios, so the directors struggled <Br>
to convince Warner Bros. to finance the project, to the point that they had to <Br>
reshoot the opening scene of Trinity to demonstrate the film's potential. <Br>
There were also great physical demands, as the actors had to train for months <Br>
in martial arts despite injuries and limitationsâ€”such as Keanu Reeves, <Br>
who was recovering from neck surgery, and Carrie-Anne Moss, who hid a sprained <Br>
ankle to avoid losing the role. Added to all this was a tight initial budget<Br>
 and distrust from the producers, but the effort ultimately <Br>
resulted in a work that revolutionized science fiction and action films.<Br>
