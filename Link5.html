<B></B>Interesting facts<Br> <Br> 
 
🎬 1. The Wachowskis Had to Prove Themselves<Br> 
Before the studio greenlit the full film, the Wachowskis <Br> 
had to create a 10-minute proof-of-concept scene (the lobby shootout)<Br>  
to convince Warner Bros. that they could pull off such a complex movie.<Br> <Br> 

🥋 2. Actors Trained for Months<Br> 
The main cast (Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne) <Br> 
trained in martial arts for 4 months, 6–8 hours a day, with choreographer<Br> 
 Yuen Woo-ping, one of the top action coordinators in Hong Kong cinema.<Br> <Br> 

🕶️ 3. Iconic Sunglasses<Br> 
Each character's sunglasses were custom-designed to reflect their personality. <Br> 
For example, Morpheus’s lenses are round and philosophical-looking, while Neo’s are sleek and minimal.<Br> <Br> 

💊 4. Red Pill vs. Blue Pill<Br> 
The "red pill vs. blue pill" choice became a pop culture symbol.<Br>  
It’s now used in debates about truth, reality, and awakening to uncomfortable knowledge.<Br> <Br> 

🧠 5. The Code Is Not What You Think<Br> 
The green falling Matrix code is actually made up of Japanese <Br> 
katakana characters, numbers, and random symbols. The designer 
said it was inspired by sushi recipes from his wife's Japanese cookbooks!<Br> <Br> 

🕴️ 6. Keanu Had Neck Surgery <Br> 
Keanu Reeves had neck surgery before training began and wore a <Br> 
neck brace during the early months of martial arts prep. Some <Br> 
scenes were adapted to be less physically intense for him.<Br> <Br> 

💥 7. Bullet Time Was Revolutionary<Br> 
The "bullet time" effect, where time slows and the camera spins <Br> 
around the action, was a groundbreaking technique at the time.<Br> 
 It combined CGI with dozens of still cameras in a circular setup.<Br> <Br> 

🔄 8. The Matrix Is Full of Philosophy<Br> 
The film is packed with references to Buddhism, Christianity, Plato’s<Br> 
Allegory of the Cave, and French postmodern philosophy—especially <Br> <Br> 
questions about reality and perception.<Br> 

🎭 9. Will Smith Turned Down Neo<Br> 
Will Smith was originally offered the role of Neo but turned it down to do <Br> 
Wild Wild West. He later admitted he didn’t understand the script at the time.<Br> <Br> 

🖥️ 10. The Matrix Inspired Countless Other Films<Br> 
The Matrix had a massive impact on action and sci-fi cinema. Its visual style, <Br> 
slow-motion action, and philosophical depth have influenced everything from Inception to John Wick.<Br> <Br>
